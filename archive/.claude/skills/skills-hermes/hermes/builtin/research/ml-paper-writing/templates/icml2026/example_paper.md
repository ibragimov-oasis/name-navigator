Submission and Formatting Instructions for
International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2026)
Anonymous Authors1
Abstract
This document provides a basic paper template
and submission guidelines. Abstracts must be a
single paragraph, ideally between 4–6 sentences
long. Gross violations will trigger corrections at
the camera-ready phase.
1. Electronic Submission
Submission to ICML 2026 will be entirely electronic, via
a web site (not email). Information about the submission
process and LATEX templates are available on the conference
web site at:
http://icml.cc/
The guidelines below will be enforced for initial submis-
sions and camera-ready copies. Here is a brief summary:
• Submissions must be in PDF.
• If your paper has appendices, submit the appendix
together with the main body and the references as a
single file. Reviewers will not look for appendices as a
separate PDF file. So if you submit such an extra file,
reviewers will very likely miss it.
• Page limit: The main body of the paper has to be fitted
to 8 pages, excluding references and appendices; the
space for the latter two is not limited in pages, but
the total file size may not exceed 10MB. For the final
version of the paper, authors can add one extra page to
the main body.
• Do not include author information or acknowledge-
ments in your initial submission.
• Your paper should be in 10 point Times font.
1Anonymous Institution, Anonymous City, Anonymous Region,
Anonymous Country. Correspondence to: Anonymous Author
<anon.email@domain.com>.
Preliminary work. Under review by the International Conference
on Machine Learning (ICML). Do not distribute.
• Make sure your PDF file only uses Type-1 fonts.
• Place figure captions under the figure (and omit titles
from inside the graphic file itself). Place table captions
over the table.
• References must include page numbers whenever pos-
sible and be as complete as possible. Place multiple
citations in chronological order.
• Do not alter the style template; in particular, do not
compress the paper format by reducing the vertical
spaces.
• Keep your abstract brief and self-contained, one para-
graph and roughly 4–6 sentences. Gross violations will
require correction at the camera-ready phase. The title
should have content words capitalized.
1.1. Submitting Papers
Anonymous Submission: ICML uses double-blind review:
no identifying author information may appear on the title
page or in the paper itself. Section 2.3 gives further details.
Authors must provide their manuscripts in PDF format. Fur-
thermore, please make sure that files contain only embedded
Type-1 fonts (e.g., using the program pdffonts in linux
or using File/DocumentProperties/Fonts in Acrobat). Other
fonts (like Type-3) might come from graphics files imported
into the document.
Authors using Word must convert their document to PDF.
Most of the latest versions of Word have the facility to do
this automatically. Submissions will not be accepted in
Word format or any format other than PDF. Really. We’re
not joking. Don’t send Word.
Those who use LATEX should avoid including Type-3 fonts.
Those using latex and dvips may need the following
two commands:
dvips -Ppdf -tletter -G0 -o paper.ps paper.dvi
ps2pdf paper.ps
It is a zero following the “-G”, which tells dvips to use the
config.pdf file. Newer TEX distributions don’t always need
this option.

Submission and Formatting Instructions for ICML 2026
Using pdflatex rather than latex, often gives better
results. This program avoids the Type-3 font problem, and
supports more advanced features in the microtype pack-
age.
Graphics files should be a reasonable size, and included
from an appropriate format. Use vector formats (.eps/.pdf)
for plots, lossless bitmap formats (.png) for raster graphics
with sharp lines, and jpeg for photo-like images.
The style file uses the hyperref package to make click-
able links in documents. If this causes problems for you,
add nohyperref as one of the options to the icml2026
usepackage statement.
1.2. Submitting Final Camera-Ready Copy
The final versions of papers accepted for publication should
follow the same format and naming convention as initial
submissions, except that author information (names and af-
filiations) should be given. See Section 2.3.2 for formatting
instructions.
The footnote, “Preliminary work. Under review by the
International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML).
Do not distribute.” must be modified to “Proceedings of
the 43 rd International Conference on Machine Learning,
Seoul, South Korea, PMLR 306, 2026. Copyright 2026 by
the author(s).”
For those using the LATEX style file, this change (and
others) is handled automatically by simply changing
\usepackage{icml2026} to
\usepackage[accepted]{icml2026}
Authors using Word must edit the footnote on the first page
of the document themselves.
Camera-ready copies should have the title of the paper as
running head on each page except the first one. The running
title consists of a single line centered above a horizontal rule
which is 1 point thick. The running head should be centered,
bold and in 9 point type. The rule should be 10 points
above the main text. For those using the LATEX style file, the
original title is automatically set as running head using the
fancyhdr package which is included in the ICML 2026
style file package. In case that the original title exceeds the
size restrictions, a shorter form can be supplied by using
\icmltitlerunning{...}
just before \begin{document}. Authors using Word must
edit the header of the document themselves.
2. Format of the Paper
All submissions must follow the specified format.
2.1. Dimensions
The text of the paper should be formatted in two columns,
with an overall width of 6.75 inches, height of 9.0 inches,
and 0.25 inches between the columns. The left margin
should be 0.75 inches and the top margin 1.0 inch (2.54 cm).
The right and bottom margins will depend on whether you
print on US letter or A4 paper, but all final versions must be
produced for US letter size. Do not write anything on the
margins.
The paper body should be set in 10 point type with a vertical
spacing of 11 points. Please use Times typeface throughout
the text.
2.2. Title
The paper title should be set in 14 point bold type and
centered between two horizontal rules that are 1 point thick,
with 1.0 inch between the top rule and the top edge of the
page. Capitalize the first letter of content words and put the
rest of the title in lower case. You can use TeX math in the
title (we suggest sparingly), but no custom macros, images,
or other TeX commands. Please make sure that accents,
special characters, etc., are entered using TeX commands
and not using non-English characters.
2.3. Author Information for Submission
ICML uses double-blind review, so author information
must not appear.
If you are using LATEX and the
icml2026.sty file, use \icmlauthor{...} to spec-
ify authors and \icmlaffiliation{...} to specify
affiliations. (Read the TeX code used to produce this doc-
ument for an example usage.) The author information will
not be printed unless accepted is passed as an argument
to the style file. Submissions that include the author infor-
mation will not be reviewed.
2.3.1. SELF-CITATIONS
If you are citing published papers for which you are an
author, refer to yourself in the third person. In particular, do
not use phrases that reveal your identity (e.g., “in previous
work (Langley, 2000), we have shown ...”).
Do not anonymize citations in the reference section. The
only exception are manuscripts that are not yet published
(e.g., under submission). If you choose to refer to such un-
published manuscripts (Author, 2021), anonymized copies
have to be submitted as Supplementary Material via Open-
Review. However, keep in mind that an ICML paper should
be self contained and should contain sufficient detail for the
reviewers to evaluate the work. In particular, reviewers are
not required to look at the Supplementary Material when
writing their review (they are not required to look at more

than the first 8 pages of the submitted document).
2.3.2. CAMERA-READY AUTHOR INFORMATION
If a paper is accepted, a final camera-ready copy must be
prepared. For camera-ready papers, author information
should start 0.3 inches below the bottom rule surrounding
the title. The authors’ names should appear in 10 point
bold type, in a row, separated by white space, and centered.
Author names should not be broken across lines. Unbolded
superscripted numbers, starting 1, should be used to refer to
affiliations.
Affiliations should be numbered in the order of appearance.
A single footnote block of text should be used to list all
the affiliations. (Academic affiliations should list Depart-
ment, University, City, State/Region, Country. Similarly for
industrial affiliations.)
Each distinct affiliations should be listed once. If an author
has multiple affiliations, multiple superscripts should be
placed after the name, separated by thin spaces. If the au-
thors would like to highlight equal contribution by multiple
first authors, those authors should have an asterisk placed
after their name in superscript, and the term “*Equal contri-
bution” should be placed in the footnote block ahead of the
list of affiliations. A list of corresponding authors and their
emails (in the format Full Name <email@domain.com>)
can follow the list of affiliations. Ideally only one or two
names should be listed.
A sample file with author names is included in the
ICML2026 style file package. Turn on the [accepted]
option to the stylefile to see the names rendered. All of the
guidelines above are implemented by the LATEX style file.
2.4. Abstract
The paper abstract should begin in the left column,
0.4 inches below the final address. The heading ‘Abstract’
should be centered, bold, and in 11 point type. The abstract
body should use 10 point type, with a vertical spacing of
11 points, and should be indented 0.25 inches more than nor-
mal on left-hand and right-hand margins. Insert 0.4 inches
of blank space after the body. Keep your abstract brief and
self-contained, limiting it to one paragraph and roughly 4–6
sentences. Gross violations will require correction at the
camera-ready phase.
2.5. Partitioning the Text
You should organize your paper into sections and paragraphs
to help readers place a structure on the material and under-
stand its contributions.
2.5.1. SECTIONS AND SUBSECTIONS
Section headings should be numbered, flush left, and set in
11 pt bold type with the content words capitalized. Leave
0.25 inches of space before the heading and 0.15 inches
after the heading.
Similarly, subsection headings should be numbered, flush
left, and set in 10 pt bold type with the content words capi-
talized. Leave 0.2 inches of space before the heading and
0.13 inches afterward.
Finally, subsubsection headings should be numbered, flush
left, and set in 10 pt small caps with the content words
capitalized. Leave 0.18 inches of space before the heading
and 0.1 inches after the heading.
Please use no more than three levels of headings.
2.5.2. PARAGRAPHS AND FOOTNOTES
Within each section or subsection, you should further par-
tition the paper into paragraphs. Do not indent the first
line of a given paragraph, but insert a blank line between
succeeding ones.
You can use footnotes1 to provide readers with additional
information about a topic without interrupting the flow of
the paper. Indicate footnotes with a number in the text
where the point is most relevant. Place the footnote in
9 point type at the bottom of the column in which it appears.
Precede the first footnote in a column with a horizontal rule
of 0.8 inches.2
2.6. Figures
You may want to include figures in the paper to illustrate
your approach and results. Such artwork should be centered,
legible, and separated from the text. Lines should be dark
and at least 0.5 points thick for purposes of reproduction,
and text should not appear on a gray background.
Label all distinct components of each figure. If the figure
takes the form of a graph, then give a name for each axis and
include a legend that briefly describes each curve. Do not
include a title inside the figure; instead, the caption should
serve this function.
Number figures sequentially, placing the figure number and
caption after the graphics, with at least 0.1 inches of space
before the caption and 0.1 inches after it, as in Figure 1. The
figure caption should be set in 9 point type and centered
unless it runs two or more lines, in which case it should be
flush left. You may float figures to the top or bottom of a
1Footnotes should be complete sentences.
2Multiple footnotes can appear in each column, in the same
order as they appear in the text, but spread them across columns
and pages if possible.

the number of accepted papers for ICML 2008 was unknown and
instead estimated.

column, and you may set wide figures across both columns
(use the environment figure* in LATEX). Always place
two-column figures at the top or bottom of the page.
2.7. Algorithms
If you are using LATEX, please use the “algorithm” and “al-
gorithmic” environments to format pseudocode. These re-
quire the corresponding stylefiles, algorithm.sty and algo-
rithmic.sty, which are supplied with this package. Algo-
rithm 1 shows an example.
2.8. Tables
You may also want to include tables that summarize ma-
terial. Like figures, these should be centered, legible, and
numbered consecutively. However, place the title above the
Table 1. Classification accuracies for naive Bayes and flexible
Bayes on various data sets.

table with at least 0.1 inches of space before the title and
the same after it, as in Table 1. The table title should be set
in 9 point type and centered unless it runs two or more lines,
in which case it should be flush left.
Tables contain textual material, whereas figures contain
graphical material. Specify the contents of each row and
column in the table’s topmost row. Again, you may float
tables to a column’s top or bottom, and set wide tables
across both columns. Place two-column tables at the top or
bottom of the page.
2.9. Theorems and Such
The preferred way is to number definitions, propositions,
lemmas, etc. consecutively, within sections, as shown be-
low.
Definition 2.1. A function f : X →Y is injective if for
any x, y ∈X different, f(x) ̸= f(y).
Using Definition 2.1 we immediate get the following result:
Proposition 2.2. If f is injective mapping a set X to an-
other set Y , the cardinality of Y is at least as large as that
of X
Proof. Left as an exercise to the reader.
Lemma 2.3 stated next will prove to be useful.
Lemma 2.3. For any f : X →Y and g : Y →Z injective
functions, f ◦g is injective.
Theorem 2.4. If f : X →Y is bijective, the cardinality of
X and Y are the same.
An easy corollary of Theorem 2.4 is the following:
Corollary 2.5. If f : X →Y is bijective, the cardinality of
X is at least as large as that of Y .
Assumption 2.6. The set X is finite.
Remark 2.7. According to some, it is only the finite case
(cf. Assumption 2.6) that is interesting.

Submission and Formatting Instructions for ICML 2026
2.10. Citations and References
Please use APA reference format regardless of your format-
ter or word processor. If you rely on the LATEX bibliographic
facility, use natbib.sty and icml2026.bst included
in the style-file package to obtain this format.
Citations within the text should include the authors’ last
names and year. If the authors’ names are included in the
sentence, place only the year in parentheses, for example
when referencing Arthur Samuel’s pioneering work (1959).
Otherwise place the entire reference in parentheses with the
authors and year separated by a comma (Samuel, 1959). List
multiple references separated by semicolons (Kearns, 1989;
Samuel, 1959; Mitchell, 1980). Use the ‘et al.’ construct
only for citations with three or more authors or after listing
all authors to a publication in an earlier reference (Michalski
et al., 1983).
Authors should cite their own work in the third person in
the initial version of their paper submitted for blind review.
Please refer to Section 2.3 for detailed instructions on how
to cite your own papers.
Use an unnumbered first-level section heading for the refer-
ences, and use a hanging indent style, with the first line of
the reference flush against the left margin and subsequent
lines indented by 10 points. The references at the end of
this document give examples for journal articles (Samuel,
1959), conference publications (Langley, 2000), book chap-
ters (Newell & Rosenbloom, 1981), books (Duda et al.,
2000), edited volumes (Michalski et al., 1983), technical
reports (Mitchell, 1980), and dissertations (Kearns, 1989).
Alphabetize references by the surnames of the first authors,
with single author entries preceding multiple author entries.
Order references for the same authors by year of publication,
with the earliest first. Make sure that each reference includes
all relevant information (e.g., page numbers).
Please put some effort into making references complete,
presentable, and consistent, e.g. use the actual current
name of authors. If using bibtex, please protect capital
letters of names and abbreviations in titles, for example, use
{B}ayesian or {L}ipschitz in your .bib file.
Accessibility
Authors are kindly asked to make their submissions as ac-
cessible as possible for everyone including people with
disabilities and sensory or neurological differences. Tips
of how to achieve this and what to pay attention to will be
provided on the conference website http://icml.cc/.
Software and Data
If a paper is accepted, we strongly encourage the publication
of software and data with the camera-ready version of the
paper whenever appropriate. This can be done by including
a URL in the camera-ready copy. However, do not include
URLs that reveal your institution or identity in your sub-
mission for review. Instead, provide an anonymous URL or
upload the material as “Supplementary Material” into the
OpenReview reviewing system. Note that reviewers are not
required to look at this material when writing their review.
Acknowledgements
Do not include acknowledgements in the initial version of
the paper submitted for blind review.
If a paper is accepted, the final camera-ready version can
(and usually should) include acknowledgements. Such ac-
knowledgements should be placed at the end of the section,
in an unnumbered section that does not count towards the
paper page limit. Typically, this will include thanks to re-
viewers who gave useful comments, to colleagues who con-
tributed to the ideas, and to funding agencies and corporate
sponsors that provided financial support.
Impact Statement
Authors are required to include a statement of the potential
broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects
and future societal consequences. This statement should be
in an unnumbered section at the end of the paper (co-located
with Acknowledgements – the two may appear in either
order, but both must be before References), and does not
count toward the paper page limit. In many cases, where
the ethical impacts and expected societal implications are
those that are well established when advancing the field of
Machine Learning, substantial discussion is not required,
and a simple statement such as the following will suffice:
“This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field
of Machine Learning. There are many potential societal
consequences of our work, none which we feel must be
specifically highlighted here.”
The above statement can be used verbatim in such cases, but
we encourage authors to think about whether there is content
which does warrant further discussion, as this statement will
be apparent if the paper is later flagged for ethics review.

Submission and Formatting Instructions for ICML 2026
A. You can have an appendix here.
You can have as much text here as you want. The main body must be at most 8 pages long. For the final version, one more
page can be added. If you want, you can use an appendix like this one.
The \onecolumn command above can be kept in place if you prefer a one-column appendix, or can be removed if you
prefer a two-column appendix. Apart from this possible change, the style (font size, spacing, margins, page numbering, etc.)
should be kept the same as the main body.
